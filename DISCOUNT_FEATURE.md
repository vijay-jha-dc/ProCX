# ÌæÅ Auto-Discount Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
ProCX now automatically approves and applies discounts up to 10% for proactive retention, simulating what would happen with a real payment gateway integration.

## How It Works

### 1. **Discount Calculation Logic**
Based on churn risk level:

| Churn Risk | Discount | Auto-Approved? | Action |
|-----------|----------|----------------|--------|
| **80%+ (Critical)** | 10% | ‚úÖ YES (if regular customer) | Auto-applied |
| **80%+ (VIP/High LTV)** | 15% | ‚ùå NO | Escalate to human |
| **60-79% (High)** | 7% | ‚úÖ YES | Auto-applied |
| **50-59% (Medium)** | 5% | ‚úÖ YES | Auto-applied |
| **<50% (Low)** | None | N/A | No discount |

### 2. **Auto-Approval Rules**
```python
if discount_percentage <= 10%:
    ‚Üí Auto-approve and apply
    ‚Üí Show in customer message: "We've applied a 7% discount"
    ‚Üí Log: "‚úÖ AUTO-APPROVED: 7% discount applied to customer account"
else:
    ‚Üí Escalate to human for approval
    ‚Üí Log: "‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS APPROVAL: 15% discount requires human authorization"
```

### 3. **Integration Points**

**Decision Agent** (`agents/decision_agent.py`):
- Calculates appropriate discount percentage
- Determines if auto-approval is allowed
- Sets `state.discount_applied` and `state.discount_auto_approved`
- Adds to escalation criteria if >10%

**Empathy Agent** (`agents/empathy_agent.py`):
- Receives discount info in prompt
- Mentions discount naturally in customer message
- Only mentions if auto-approved (not if pending human approval)

**AgentState** (`models/customer.py`):
- New fields:
  - `discount_applied: Optional[float]` - Percentage (e.g., 7.0 for 7%)
  - `discount_auto_approved: bool` - True if system auto-approved ‚â§10%

## Example Outputs

### Case 1: Auto-Approved 7% Discount
```
Customer: Aditya Bhat (C100487)
Churn Risk: 77.5%
Discount: 7.0% ‚úÖ AUTO-APPROVED

Message:
"Hi Aditya, we've added a 7% discount to your account as a token 
of appreciation for being a valued customer..."
```

### Case 2: Escalation for 15% Discount
```
Customer: Rajesh Malhotra (VIP, ‚Çπ8,500 LTV)
Churn Risk: 88%
Discount: 15.0% ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS HUMAN APPROVAL

Status: ESCALATED TO HUMAN AGENT
Recommended Action: "Approve 15% discount + personalized retention package"
```

## Hackathon Positioning

### What We're Showing:
‚úÖ **AI decides discount amount** based on churn risk
‚úÖ **Auto-approval for ‚â§10%** (no human needed)
‚úÖ **Escalation for >10%** (human oversight)
‚úÖ **Discount mentioned in customer message**
‚úÖ **System "processes" discount** (simulated)

### What's Simulated:
- No real payment gateway integration
- Discount not actually applied to billing system
- Just demonstration of logic + message generation

### Production Readiness:
**"In production, this connects to:**
- Payment gateway API (Stripe/Razorpay)
- CRM system (Salesforce/HubSpot)  
- Billing platform (Chargebee/Zuora)

The logic is ready - just needs API endpoints."

## Technical Implementation

### Files Changed:
1. `models/customer.py` - Added discount fields to AgentState
2. `agents/decision_agent.py` - Added `_calculate_proactive_discount()` method
3. `agents/empathy_agent.py` - Added discount info to prompt
4. `config/prompts.py` - Added discount_info parameter to empathy prompt

### Testing:
```bash
# Test with real high-churn customer
python test_discount.py

# Expected output:
# [OK] Discount Applied: 7.0%
# [OK] Auto-Approved: True
# [MESSAGE] YES - Discount mentioned in customer message
```

## Demo Commands

### Show Auto-Approval:
```bash
python main.py --interventions --max-interventions 3
```
Look for: `‚úÖ AUTO-APPROVED: X% discount applied`

### Show Escalation (>10%):
```bash
python demo_escalation.py
```
Look for: `‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS APPROVAL: 15% discount requires human authorization`

## Key Messages for Judges

1. **Intelligent Thresholds**: System knows when to auto-approve vs escalate
2. **Proactive**: Discount offered BEFORE customer complains
3. **Data-Driven**: Amount based on actual churn risk calculation
4. **Cost Control**: Hard limit at 10% for automation
5. **Production-Ready Logic**: Just needs payment gateway integration
