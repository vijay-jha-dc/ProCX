## 🚀 Quick Start Commands

### From Root Directory (ProCX/)

```bash
# Test data integration
python test_data_integration.py

# Run demo mode (3 pre-configured scenarios)
export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
python main.py --mode demo

# Run test mode (random event)
export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
python main.py --mode test

# Run interactive mode
export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
python main.py --mode interactive
```

**Note:** The `export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` is needed for Windows to display emojis correctly.

## 🎤 Key Talking Points

### 1. **Not Just Prompts** (30 seconds)
"Unlike other solutions that just send prompts to GPT-4, we combine real data science with LLM intelligence."

**Show:** Open `utils/data_analytics.py`, point to similarity algorithm:
```python
similarity = (
    segment_match * 0.4 +
    ltv_similarity * 0.3 +
    category_match * 0.2 +
    tier_match * 0.1
)
```

### 2. **Real Data Integration** (30 seconds)
"Every decision is backed by actual customer database analysis - not assumptions."

**Show:** Run `python test_data_integration.py`
- ✅ Found 3 similar customers with 87% similarity
- ✅ VIP segment: 42 customers, avg LTV $2,798
- ✅ Customer at 67th percentile in cohort

### 3. **Multi-Agent Architecture** (30 seconds)
"4 specialized agents orchestrated with LangGraph, each with a specific role."

**Show:** Architecture flow:
```
Event → Context → Pattern → Decision → Empathy → Response
         ↓          ↓          ↓          ↓
     Sentiment   Churn    Escalation  Personalized
     Analysis    Risk                  Response
```

### 4. **Hybrid Intelligence** (30 seconds)
"60% data-driven + 40% LLM for churn prediction = best of both worlds."

**Show:** Pattern Agent code or mention the hybrid calculation

### 5. **Production-Ready** (30 seconds)
"Error handling, fallback logic, memory persistence, modular design - ready for scale."

**Show:** Mention 1000-customer dataset, JSONL persistence, error recovery

## 🏆 Differentiators

### vs. "Just Using ChatGPT"
- ✅ We have **real similarity algorithms** (not just asking ChatGPT)
- ✅ We have **cohort analysis** and **percentile rankings**
- ✅ We have **data-driven churn risk** calculation
- ✅ We have **LangGraph orchestration** for multi-agent workflow

### vs. Traditional CX Tools
- ✅ AI-powered instead of rule-based
- ✅ Real-time personalization using customer data
- ✅ Proactive churn prevention (not reactive)
- ✅ Multi-agent specialization (not single-prompt)

### vs. Other Hackathon Projects
- ✅ Actually uses the provided dataset (not mocked)
- ✅ Production-ready architecture (not just a demo)
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (easy for judges to understand)
- ✅ Test scripts prove it works (verifiable claims)

## 📊 Demo Flow (Recommended)

### **Total Time: 3-4 minutes**

1. **Problem** (20 sec): "Customer service is either generic or manual"
2. **Solution** (20 sec): "Multi-agent AI with real data integration"
3. **Live Demo** (90 sec): Run `python main.py --mode demo`
   - Show VIP complaint scenario
   - Point out sentiment, churn risk, similar customers
   - Highlight personalized response
4. **Data Proof** (30 sec): Show test output
   - "87% similarity matching"
   - "Actual cohort percentiles"
5. **Differentiation** (20 sec): "Not just prompts - real algorithms"
6. **Q&A** (20 sec): Be ready for technical questions

## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: Emoji Encoding Error
**Error:** `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode...`

**Fix:**
```bash
export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8
python main.py --mode demo
```

### Issue 2: OpenAI Model Not Found
**Error:** `The model 'gpt-4' does not exist or you do not have access to it`

**Fix:** ✅ Already fixed - using `gpt-4o-mini` instead

### Issue 3: No API Key
**Error:** `OPENAI_API_KEY not found`

**Fix:** ✅ Already configured in `.env` file

## 📞 Emergency Troubleshooting

If something breaks during the demo:

1. **Show test output instead:** "Let me show you the test results that prove it works..."
2. **Show the code:** "Here's the similarity algorithm we implemented..."
3. **Explain the architecture:** "Even if the demo fails, let me walk you through the design..."
4. **Stay confident:** "This is a known Windows encoding issue, but as you can see from the tests..."

Remember: Judges care more about your **thinking** and **approach** than perfect execution.
