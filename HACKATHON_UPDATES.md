# ProCX Hackathon Updates - Oct 25, 2025

## ✅ Implemented Fixes

### 1. **Escalation Shows Recommended Actions for Human Agents**
**File:** `workflows/cx_workflow.py`

**Change:** Modified `escalation_node()` to include detailed context for human agents:
```python
escalation_message = "🚨 ESCALATED TO HUMAN AGENT\n"
escalation_message += f"Recommended Action: {updated_state.recommended_action}\n"
escalation_message += f"Priority: {updated_state.priority_level}\n"
escalation_message += f"Churn Risk: {updated_state.predicted_churn_risk:.1%}"
```

**Impact:** When a case is escalated, human agents now see:
- Recommended action plan
- Priority level (critical/high/medium/low)
- Churn risk percentage
- All context from previous agents

---

### 2. **Duplicate Intervention Prevention (24-Hour Window)**
**File:** `main.py` - `process_proactive_event()`

**Change:** Added memory check before processing customers:
```python
recent_history = self.memory_handler.get_recent_interactions(
    event.customer.customer_id,
    days=1  # Last 24 hours
)

if recent_history:
    last_interaction = recent_history[0]
    timestamp = datetime.fromisoformat(last_interaction['timestamp'])
    hours_ago = (datetime.now() - timestamp).total_seconds() / 3600
    
    if hours_ago < 24:
        # SKIP - Already contacted
        return AgentState with skip message
```

**Impact:**
- Customers contacted in last 24 hours are automatically skipped
- Prevents spam/duplicate interventions
- Shows `[SKIP]` message with hours since last contact
- Memory system now actively prevents duplicates (not just logging)

---

### 3. **Demo Trusts Agent's Escalation Decision**
**File:** `demo_escalation.py`

**Before:**
```python
# Check escalation rules manually (since agent might not set it correctly)
escalation_triggered = False
# ... manual rule checking ...
```

**After:**
```python
# 🔥 TRUST THE AGENT - Check if agent made escalation decision
if result.escalation_needed:
    # Show agent's decision and recommended actions
```

**Changes:**
- Removed 50+ lines of manual escalation rule checking
- Now displays agent's actual decision (`result.escalation_needed`)
- Shows recommended actions for human agents
- Added "Next Steps for Human Agent" section with:
  1. Review customer history
  2. Direct phone call within 2 hours
  3. Consider recommended action
  4. Prepare retention offer
  5. Executive review if needed

**Impact:**
- Demo now showcases actual AI decision-making (not hardcoded logic)
- More authentic for hackathon presentation
- Demonstrates trust in multi-agent system

---

### 4. **Unicode Emoji Handling (Windows Terminal)**
**Files:** `demo_escalation.py`, `demo_realtime.py`

**Added:**
```python
def safe_print(text: str):
    """Print text safely, handling Unicode encoding errors."""
    try:
        print(text)
    except UnicodeEncodeError:
        ascii_text = text.encode('ascii', 'ignore').decode('ascii')
        print(ascii_text)
```

**Impact:**
- All demos work on Windows terminal (cp1252 encoding)
- Emojis gracefully stripped if terminal doesn't support Unicode
- No more `UnicodeEncodeError` crashes during demos

## 📊 System Improvements Summary

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Escalation Info** | Generic "escalated to human" message | Full context: action, priority, churn risk, next steps |
| **Duplicate Prevention** | ❌ None - same customers every scan | ✅ 24-hour window - skip if recently contacted |
| **Demo Authenticity** | Manual rule checking (demo theater) | ✅ Trust agent's actual AI decision |
| **Terminal Compatibility** | Crashes on emojis (Windows) | ✅ Works on all terminals |

## 🎯 Hackathon Demo Flow (Updated)

### Demo 1: Dashboard
```bash
python main.py --dashboard
```
Shows 112 at-risk customers, categorized by risk level.

### Demo 2: Real-Time Event
```bash
python demo_realtime.py
```
- Payment failure event (Tanya Kumar)
- 4-agent workflow processes in <22 seconds
- Tamil message with Diwali context
- Shows event-driven architecture

### Demo 3: Batch Interventions
```bash
python main.py --interventions --max-interventions 2
```
- Scans top 2 at-risk customers
- **NEW:** Skips if contacted in last 24 hours
- Shows personalized messages in native languages

### Demo 4: VIP Escalation
```bash
python demo_escalation.py
```
- Rajesh Malhotra (VIP, 88% churn risk, ₹8,500 LTV)
- **NEW:** Shows recommended action for human agent
- **NEW:** Trusts agent's escalation decision
- Displays next steps for human intervention

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Memory System (Now Active)
- **Saves:** All interactions to `data/memory/{customer_id}.jsonl`
- **Reads:** Last 24 hours before processing new intervention
- **Prevents:** Same-day duplicate interventions
- **Format:** JSONL with timestamp, customer_id, event_type, full AgentState

### Escalation System (Enhanced)
- **Decision:** AI agent makes call based on 3 rules:
  1. VIP + churn risk >80%
  2. High LTV (>$5,000) + churn risk >85%
  3. Low CSAT history (<2.5)
- **Tracking:** `EscalationTracker` prevents duplicate handling
- **Context:** Full recommended action + priority + risk scores
- **Human Handoff:** Clear next steps provided

## 📝 What We're Showing vs Doing

### ✅ What's REAL (AI-Driven):
- Agent makes escalation decisions (3 rules in `decision_agent.py`)
- 24-hour duplicate prevention (memory system)
- Multi-language personalized messages (GPT-4o)
- Cultural context (9 festivals, 5 languages)
- Health scoring (10 factors from 18,550+ records)

### ⚠️ What's DEMO (Simulation):
- No actual emails sent (just text generation)
- No payment processing (recommendations only)
- Synthetic customer in escalation demo (Rajesh Malhotra)
- No live webhooks (simulated event triggers)

### 🎯 Hackathon Positioning:
**"ProCX generates AI-powered recommendations and draft messages. In production, this connects to email/SMS APIs, payment systems, and CRM platforms."**
