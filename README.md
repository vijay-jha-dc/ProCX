## 🎯 The Problem We Solve

Traditional customer service is **reactive** - companies wait for customers to complain, then scramble to fix issues. By then, damage is already done and customers are often lost.

**ProCX flips the script with 100% proactive intelligence:**

- 🔮 **Predicts** churn risk before customers complain
- 🛡️ **Prevents** churn with early, culturally-aware interventions
- 📊 **Protects** revenue by saving at-risk customers proactively
- 🧠 **Learns** from historical patterns and resolution effectiveness
- 🌍 **Adapts** messaging for cultural context (festivals, language, timing)

---

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. 🔮 Proactive Monitoring

- **Real-time health scoring** using 10-dimensional customer health model
- **Automated scanning** to identify at-risk customers before complaints
- **Pre-emptive intervention** generation with escalation continuity
- **Dashboard visualization** of customer health distribution
- **No reactive mode** - pure prevention focus

### 2. 🧠 Multi-Agent

Four specialized agents working in sequence:

- **Bodha (बोध) - Awareness**: Context extraction and sentiment analysis
- **Dhyana (ध्यान) - Insight**: Pattern mining and churn prediction
- **Niti (नीति) - Strategy**: Decision making and escalation logic
- **Karuna (करुणा) - Compassion**: Empathetic, culturally-aware messaging

### 3. �️ Escalation Continuity & Memory

- **Escalation tracking** prevents duplicate automated interventions
- **Interaction history** preserves context across scans
- **Human-in-the-loop** integration with skip logic
- **JSONL persistence** for transparent audit trails

### 4. 📊 Comprehensive Data Integration

- **5-sheet dataset**: customers, orders, support_tickets, churn_labels, nps_surveys
- **Real-time analytics** on customer cohorts and segment comparisons
- **10-factor health scoring** algorithm with weighted calculations
- **Hybrid churn risk model**: 70% behavioral + 30% ML predicted
