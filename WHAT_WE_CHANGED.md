# What We Changed: Before vs After

## Summary of Changes (October 25, 2025)

This document explains the key changes made to transform ProCX from a **recommendation system** to an **action-execution system** with **AI-driven decisions** (not hardcoded rules).

---

## üéØ Core Philosophy Shift

### **BEFORE:**

- System only **RECOMMENDED** actions
- Hardcoded discount tiers (if churn_risk >= 0.8: discount = 10%)
- Demo files had their own escalation logic (duplicate code)
- "Recommended Action" but nothing actually happened

### **AFTER:**

- System **EXECUTES** safe actions automatically
- AI (GPT-4o) decides discounts dynamically (0-15%)
- Single workflow used by all files (no duplicate logic)
- Clear distinction: "Recommended Action" (for humans) vs "Action Taken" (what system DID)

---

## üìÅ File-by-File Changes

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **main.py**

### **BEFORE (Old main.py):**

```python
# Just processed events and displayed results
result = platform.process_proactive_event(event, verbose=True)

if verbose:
    print(f"Recommended Action: {result.recommended_action}")
    print(f"Personalized Message: {result.personalized_response}")
```

**Issues:**

- ‚ùå Didn't show what was EXECUTED vs just recommended
- ‚ùå No distinction between automated actions vs escalations
- ‚ùå No discount execution status
- ‚ùå No 24-hour duplicate prevention

### **AFTER (Current main.py):**

```python
# Check for duplicate contact in last 24 hours
recent_history = self.memory_handler.get_recent_interactions(
    event.customer.customer_id, days=1
)
if recent_history:
    hours_ago = (datetime.now() - timestamp).total_seconds() / 3600
    if hours_ago < 24:
        # Skip - already contacted recently
        return AgentState with skip message

# Process event
result = platform.process_proactive_event(event, verbose=False)

# Show what agent EXECUTED (not just recommended)
if result.action_taken:
    print(f"[ACTION] Recommended Action: {result.recommended_action}")

    if result.discount_applied:
        if result.discount_auto_approved:
            print(f"[EXECUTED] ‚úÖ Applied {result.discount_applied}% discount to customer account")
        else:
            print(f"[PENDING] ‚ö†Ô∏è {result.discount_applied}% discount queued for human approval")

    if result.escalation_needed:
        print(f"[ESCALATED] üö® Case assigned to human agent (Priority: {result.priority_level})")
        print(f"[CONTEXT] Agent prepared: {result.recommended_action[:100]}...")
    else:
        print(f"[COMPLETED] ‚úÖ Automated intervention executed successfully")
```

**What Changed:**

- ‚úÖ **Added:** 24-hour duplicate prevention (no spam)
- ‚úÖ **Added:** Shows what was EXECUTED vs PENDING
- ‚úÖ **Added:** Clear status: [EXECUTED], [PENDING], [ESCALATED], [COMPLETED]
- ‚úÖ **Added:** Displays discount execution status
- ‚úÖ **Added:** Shows escalation context for human agents

**Lines Changed:** ~50 lines added in `run_proactive_scan()` and `process_proactive_event()`

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **demo_escalation.py**

### **BEFORE (Old demo_escalation.py):**

```python
# Demo file had its OWN escalation checking logic (DUPLICATE CODE!)
result = platform.process_proactive_event(event, verbose=False)

# Manual escalation checking (didn't trust the agent!)
escalation_triggered = False

# Check VIP status
if customer.segment == "VIP":
    escalation_triggered = True

# Check churn risk
if churn_risk >= 0.8:
    escalation_triggered = True

# Check discount amount
if discount_amount > 10:
    escalation_triggered = True

# Display based on manual checks
if escalation_triggered:
    print("ESCALATED TO HUMAN AGENT")
else:
    print("AUTOMATED INTERVENTION")
```

**Issues:**

- ‚ùå 50+ lines of DUPLICATE escalation logic
- ‚ùå Didn't trust agent's `result.escalation_needed`
- ‚ùå Hardcoded rules (VIP + churn >= 0.8 = escalate)
- ‚ùå Demo file making business decisions (wrong layer!)
- ‚ùå If we updated decision logic, had to update demo file too

### **AFTER (Current demo_escalation.py):**

```python
# Process event (SAME WORKFLOW AS MAIN.PY!)
print("\n‚öôÔ∏è Processing...")
result = platform.process_proactive_event(event, verbose=False)

dramatic_pause(1)

# Show what agent DID (not just recommended)
if result.action_taken:
    print(f"\nüí° Action Taken by AI:")
    print(f"   {result.action_taken}")

if result.discount_applied:
    print(f"\nüéÅ Incentive Decision:")
    if result.discount_auto_approved:
        print(f"   ‚úÖ EXECUTED: {result.discount_applied}% discount applied")
    else:
        print(f"   ‚ö†Ô∏è PENDING: {result.discount_applied}% discount queued for approval")

# TRUST THE AGENT'S DECISION
if result.escalation_needed:
    print_section_header("üö® ESCALATED TO HUMAN AGENT")
    print("AI determined this situation requires human judgment.")
    print(f"\nüìã Context for Human Agent:")
    print(f"   Recommended Action: {result.recommended_action}")
else:
    print_section_header("‚úÖ AUTOMATED INTERVENTION COMPLETE")
    print(f"\nüí° Action Executed: {result.action_taken}")
```

**What Changed:**

- ‚úÖ **Removed:** 50+ lines of duplicate escalation logic
- ‚úÖ **Changed:** Now TRUSTS `result.escalation_needed` from agent
- ‚úÖ **Added:** Shows what was EXECUTED vs PENDING
- ‚úÖ **Added:** Dramatic presentation formatting (for hackathon)
- ‚úÖ **Added:** Same workflow as main.py, just prettier output

**Lines Changed:** Deleted ~50 lines, added ~30 lines of presentation code

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **agents/decision_agent.py**

### **BEFORE (Old decision_agent.py):**

```python
def _calculate_proactive_discount(self, state: AgentState) -> float:
    """
    HARDCODED discount calculation based on churn risk tiers
    """
    churn_risk = state.predicted_churn_risk or 0

    # Hardcoded tier logic
    if churn_risk >= 0.8:
        return 10.0  # High risk = 10%
    elif churn_risk >= 0.7:
        return 7.0   # Medium-high = 7%
    elif churn_risk >= 0.6:
        return 5.0   # Medium = 5%
    else:
        return 0.0   # Low risk = no discount

def make_decision(self, state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    # Calculate discount using hardcoded tiers
    discount = self._calculate_proactive_discount(state)
    state.discount_applied = discount

    # Call LLM for other decisions
    response = self.llm.invoke(prompt_text)
    result = json.loads(content)

    state.recommended_action = result.get("recommended_action", "")
    state.escalation_needed = result.get("escalation_needed", False)
```

**Issues:**

- ‚ùå Hardcoded discount tiers (not AI-driven)
- ‚ùå "How many things we will add in future?" - not scalable
- ‚ùå We decide discounts, not the agent
- ‚ùå No distinction between recommended vs executed
- ‚ùå System calculated discount BEFORE asking AI

### **AFTER (Current decision_agent.py):**

```python
# REMOVED: _calculate_proactive_discount() method entirely!

def make_decision(self, state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    # Call LLM FIRST - Agent decides EVERYTHING
    response = self.llm.invoke(prompt_text)
    result = json.loads(content)

    # Extract agent's decisions
    state.recommended_action = result.get("recommended_action", "")

    # üéÅ Extract incentive decision from AGENT (not hardcoded)
    incentive = result.get("incentive_offered", {})
    discount_pct = None
    auto_approved = False

    if incentive.get("type") == "discount" and incentive.get("discount_percentage"):
        discount_pct = float(incentive.get("discount_percentage", 0))
        auto_approved = discount_pct <= 10  # System rule: ‚â§10% = auto-approve

        state.discount_applied = discount_pct
        state.discount_auto_approved = auto_approved

        # üî• EXECUTE if auto-approved (not just recommend)
        if auto_approved:
            state.discount_executed = True
            state.action_taken = f"Applied {discount_pct}% discount to customer account"
            state.add_message("decision_agent",
                f"‚úÖ EXECUTED: {discount_pct}% discount applied to customer account")
        else:
            state.discount_executed = False
            state.action_taken = "Escalated to human for discount approval"
            state.add_message("decision_agent",
                f"‚ö†Ô∏è ESCALATION REQUIRED: {discount_pct}% discount needs human approval")
    else:
        # Agent chose different incentive or none
        incentive_type = incentive.get("type", "none")
        if incentive_type != "none":
            state.action_taken = f"Applied {incentive_type} incentive"
        else:
            state.action_taken = "Sent personalized engagement message (no incentive)"

    # Determine escalation based on agent's decision + system rules
    escalation_needed = self._should_escalate(state, discount_pct)
    state.escalation_needed = escalation_needed

    if escalation_needed:
        state.action_taken = "Escalated to human agent"
```

**What Changed:**

- ‚úÖ **Removed:** Entire `_calculate_proactive_discount()` method (35 lines)
- ‚úÖ **Changed:** LLM called FIRST (agent decides, then system enforces)
- ‚úÖ **Added:** Extract `incentive_offered` from GPT-4o response
- ‚úÖ **Added:** `discount_executed` field (tracks what was DONE)
- ‚úÖ **Added:** `action_taken` field (what system EXECUTED)
- ‚úÖ **Changed:** Agent can choose: discount, free_shipping, loyalty_points, or none
- ‚úÖ **Changed:** System only enforces 10% threshold (cost control)

**Lines Changed:** Deleted 35 lines, added 60 lines (net +25)

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **config/prompts.py (DECISION_AGENT_PROMPT)**

### **BEFORE (Old prompts.py):**

```python
DECISION_AGENT_PROMPT = """
Based on this information, decide:
1. The best recommended action
2. Whether escalation is needed
3. Priority level

ESCALATION RULES:
- VIP with negative sentiment ‚Üí ESCALATE
- Churn risk >= 0.7 ‚Üí ESCALATE
- Urgency >= 4 ‚Üí ESCALATE
- High-value customer at risk ‚Üí ESCALATE

Respond in JSON format:
{
    "recommended_action": "...",
    "escalation_needed": true/false,
    "priority_level": "low|medium|high|critical"
}
"""
```

**Issues:**

- ‚ùå No mention of incentives/discounts
- ‚ùå Hardcoded escalation rules (agent just follows rules)
- ‚ùå No guidance on when to offer discounts
- ‚ùå No structure for incentive decisions

### **AFTER (Current prompts.py):**

```python
DECISION_AGENT_PROMPT = """
Based on this information, decide:
1. The best recommended action to resolve this issue
2. Whether escalation to human agent is needed
3. Priority level (low, medium, high, critical)
4. Specific steps to take
5. **Whether to offer a proactive incentive/discount (and how much %)**

üí∞ PROACTIVE INCENTIVE GUIDELINES:
- You CAN offer discounts (0-15%) to prevent churn
- Consider: churn risk, customer value, sentiment, history
- Discounts ‚â§10% will be AUTO-APPROVED by system
- Discounts >10% will require HUMAN APPROVAL
- You don't HAVE to offer discount - only if it makes strategic sense
- Alternative incentives: free shipping, loyalty points, priority support

ESCALATION GUIDELINES (not strict rules - use judgment):
- VIP customer with negative sentiment or high churn risk
- Urgency level >= 4
- Churn risk >= 0.7
- High-value customer at risk
- Discount >10% (requires approval)
- Complex issues beyond automated handling

Respond in JSON format:
{
    "recommended_action": "Detailed action plan",
    "escalation_needed": true/false,
    "priority_level": "low|medium|high|critical",
    "action_steps": ["step1", "step2", "step3"],
    "reasoning": "Why this decision was made",
    "incentive_offered": {
        "type": "discount|loyalty_points|free_shipping|none",
        "discount_percentage": 0-15,  // Only if type=discount
        "reasoning": "Why this incentive makes sense"
    }
}
"""
```

**What Changed:**

- ‚úÖ **Added:** Incentive decision framework (60 lines)
- ‚úÖ **Added:** `incentive_offered` object in JSON response
- ‚úÖ **Changed:** RULES ‚Üí GUIDELINES (agent uses judgment)
- ‚úÖ **Added:** Auto-approval threshold explanation (‚â§10%)
- ‚úÖ **Added:** Alternative incentive options
- ‚úÖ **Added:** Strategic thinking required ("only if it makes sense")

**Lines Changed:** Added ~60 lines to prompt

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **models/customer.py (AgentState)**

### **BEFORE (Old customer.py):**

```python
@dataclass
class AgentState:
    # Decision Making
    recommended_action: Optional[str] = None
    escalation_needed: bool = False
    priority_level: Optional[str] = None

    # Empathy & Response
    empathy_score: Optional[float] = None
    personalized_response: Optional[str] = None
```

**Issues:**

- ‚ùå No discount tracking
- ‚ùå No execution status
- ‚ùå Can't tell what was DONE vs just recommended

### **AFTER (Current customer.py):**

```python
@dataclass
class AgentState:
    # Decision Making
    recommended_action: Optional[str] = None  # What agent suggests
    action_taken: Optional[str] = None  # What agent EXECUTED
    escalation_needed: bool = False
    priority_level: Optional[str] = None

    # üéÅ Proactive Incentive (Auto-approved)
    discount_applied: Optional[float] = None  # Percentage (e.g., 10.0 for 10%)
    discount_auto_approved: bool = False  # True if ‚â§10%
    discount_executed: bool = False  # True if discount was actually applied

    # Empathy & Response
    empathy_score: Optional[float] = None
    personalized_response: Optional[str] = None
    tone: Optional[str] = None
```

**What Changed:**

- ‚úÖ **Added:** `action_taken` - What system EXECUTED (vs recommended)
- ‚úÖ **Added:** `discount_applied` - Discount percentage from agent
- ‚úÖ **Added:** `discount_auto_approved` - True if ‚â§10%
- ‚úÖ **Added:** `discount_executed` - True if actually applied
- ‚úÖ **Added:** Clear separation: recommendation vs execution

**Lines Changed:** Added 4 new fields

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ **workflows/cx_workflow.py**

### **BEFORE (Old workflow):**

```python
def escalation_node(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """Handle escalation to human agents"""
    if state.escalation_needed:
        state.add_message("workflow", "Escalated to human agent")
    return state
```

**Issues:**

- ‚ùå No context provided to human agents
- ‚ùå Just a flag, no actionable information
- ‚ùå Human agents don't know WHY it was escalated

### **AFTER (Current workflow):**

```python
def escalation_node(state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
    """
    Handle escalation with full context for human agents.
    Run empathy agent first to prepare message, then add escalation context.
    """
    if state.escalation_needed:
        # Run empathy agent to prepare message
        from agents.empathy_agent import create_empathy_agent
        empathy_agent = create_empathy_agent()
        updated_state = empathy_agent(state)

        # Add escalation context
        escalation_message = "üö® ESCALATED TO HUMAN AGENT\n"
        escalation_message += f"Recommended Action: {updated_state.recommended_action}\n"
        escalation_message += f"Priority: {updated_state.priority_level}\n"
        escalation_message += f"Churn Risk: {updated_state.predicted_churn_risk:.1%}\n"

        if updated_state.discount_applied:
            escalation_message += f"Discount Recommendation: {updated_state.discount_applied}%\n"
            if not updated_state.discount_auto_approved:
                escalation_message += "‚ö†Ô∏è Requires human approval (>10%)\n"

        updated_state.add_message("escalation", escalation_message)
        return updated_state

    return state
```

**What Changed:**

- ‚úÖ **Added:** Run empathy agent to prepare message
- ‚úÖ **Added:** Full context for humans (action, priority, churn risk)
- ‚úÖ **Added:** Discount recommendation display
- ‚úÖ **Added:** Clear indicators for what needs approval

**Lines Changed:** Added ~25 lines

---

## üÜï Files Created

- **Content:**
  - Core philosophy (AI decides, system enforces)
  - 4 example scenarios showing different agent decisions
  - Why this is better than hardcoded rules
  - Future scalability (add incentives via prompts only)
  - Hackathon judge messaging

### **Deleted Files:**

- ‚ùå `test_action_execution.py` - Temporary test file
- ‚ùå `test_discount.py` - Temporary test file
- ‚ùå `demo_escalation_v2.py` - Renamed to demo_escalation.py

## üìä Overall Impact

### **Before:**

```
Hardcoded Rules ‚Üí Limited Decisions ‚Üí Just Recommendations
      ‚Üì                  ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
   if churn_risk        Always same        Nothing actually
   >= 0.8: 10%         for same risk      happens (just logs)
```

### **After:**

```
AI Analysis ‚Üí Dynamic Decisions ‚Üí Actual Execution
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
  GPT-4o         Different for        System EXECUTES
  analyzes       each customer        safe actions
  context        (0-15%, or none)     (‚â§10% auto-approved)
```

## üí° For Hackathon Presentation

**Key Message:**

> "We built an AI-driven system where the agent makes 95% of decisions, and the system enforces 5% safety rules. Adding new features doesn't require code changes - just update the AI's prompt!"

**Demo Points:**

1. Show same workflow handles all scenarios (main.py vs demos)
2. Show AI makes different decisions for different customers
3. Show system EXECUTES safe actions (not just recommends)
4. Show escalation provides full context to humans
5. Emphasize: No hardcoded business logic, fully scalable
