# 📋 ANSWERS TO YOUR 3 QUESTIONS

## 0️⃣ Why Do We Need EventSimulator?

### Short Answer:
**For DEMO MODE only** - to show judges how the agents work with controlled scenarios.

### Detailed Answer:

**EventSimulator = "Show and Tell" Tool**

| Mode | Uses EventSimulator? | Why? |
|------|---------------------|------|
| **Proactive** | ❌ NO | Uses ProactiveMonitor to scan real Excel data |
| **Demo** | ✅ YES | Creates pre-defined scenarios to showcase agents |
| **Event-Driven** | ✅ YES | Simulates webhooks (since we don't have real ones) |

**What It Does:**
```python
# Creates realistic test scenarios:
- Payment failure from "Stripe"
- Order cancellation
- Negative NPS feedback
- Support ticket escalation
```

**Why Keep It:**
- Judges want to SEE agents in action
- Provides controlled, dramatic scenarios
- Demonstrates the full workflow
- Shows event-driven capability

**Why It's NOT Cheating:**
- Clearly labeled as "demo mode"
- Proactive mode uses REAL data
- Production would use real webhooks (EventSimulator replaced)

**Bottom Line:** It's your presentation tool. The real intelligence is in the agents and ProactiveMonitor.

## 1️⃣ How to Run Scheduler & When to Start?

### Quick Commands:

```bash
# For judges (one-time scan):
python proactive_scheduler.py --mode once

# For continuous monitoring (production simulation):
python proactive_scheduler.py --mode continuous --interval 5

# High-risk only:
python proactive_scheduler.py --mode once --risk-threshold 0.8
```

### Demo Strategy for Hackathon:

#### **30 Minutes BEFORE Judges Arrive:**

**Terminal 1: Start Background Scheduler**
```bash
python proactive_scheduler.py --mode continuous --interval 5
```

**Let it run!** This accumulates stats:
- Scan #1, #2, #3... #6
- "20 scans completed, 35 interventions triggered"
- Shows "running for 30 minutes without human intervention"

#### **DURING Presentation:**

**Show Terminal 1 (Background Scheduler):**
> "See this? Been running for 30 minutes. Zero human intervention. 
> Scanned 1,000 customers 6 times. Detected 35 at-risk. 
> Generated personalized interventions. Fully automated."

**Then Run One-Time Scan (Terminal 2):**
```bash
python proactive_scheduler.py --mode once
```

**Live demo:**
> "Let me run a scan right now, in front of you..."
> [Watch it detect customers, run agents, generate interventions]
> "That's proactive. Not reactive. Not waiting for complaints."

### Arguments Explained:

| Argument | Default | What It Does | Example |
|----------|---------|--------------|---------|
| `--mode` | `once` | `once` = single scan<br>`continuous` = runs forever | `--mode continuous` |
| `--interval` | `5` | Minutes between scans | `--interval 10` |
| `--risk-threshold` | `0.6` | Min churn risk to trigger (60%) | `--risk-threshold 0.75` |
| `--max-interventions` | `10` | Limit per scan (avoid spam) | `--max-interventions 5` |

### When to Start (Summary):

| Timing | Action | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| **30 min before** | Start continuous mode | Accumulate stats, prove automation |
| **During demo** | Run once mode | Live demonstration |
| **After demo** | Keep continuous running | Shows ongoing monitoring |
