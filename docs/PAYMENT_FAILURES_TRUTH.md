# üö® IMPORTANT: "3 Failed Payments" - The Truth

## Your Question

> "so now 3 payments failed this part is not hardcoded correct?"

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Answer: **IT'S NOT IN YOUR CODE YET**

---

## What's ACTUALLY in Your Current Code

### In `main.py` (line 227):

```python
description = f"""{customer.segment} customer at high risk (LTV: ${customer.lifetime_value:,.2f})
‚Ä¢ Health Score: {health_score:.0f}/100 ({health_status})
‚Ä¢ Churn Risk: {churn_risk:.0f}%
‚Ä¢ Risk Factors: {', '.join(alert['reasons'][:3])}
‚Ä¢ Recommended Action: {alert['recommended_action'].replace('_', ' ').title()}"""
```

### What `alert['reasons']` Actually Contains (from proactive_monitor.py line 288):

```python
reasons = []
if health_score < 0.4:
    reasons.append("Low health score")  # ‚Üê Hardcoded text
if customer.segment in ["VIP", "Loyal"]:
    reasons.append("High-value segment at risk")  # ‚Üê Hardcoded text
if cohort_data and cohort_data.get('customer_percentile', 50) < 30:
    reasons.append("Below-average in cohort")  # ‚Üê Hardcoded text
if not reasons:
    reasons.append("General churn risk indicators")  # ‚Üê Hardcoded text
```

### So Your Actual Output Is:

```
VIP customer at high risk (LTV: $45,230.50)
‚Ä¢ Health Score: 58/100 (Warning)
‚Ä¢ Churn Risk: 68%
‚Ä¢ Risk Factors: Low health score, High-value segment at risk, Below-average in cohort
‚Ä¢ Recommended Action: Immediate Personal Outreach
```

## ‚ùå What You DON'T Have

You do NOT have:

- "3 failed payments in last 30 days"
- "NPS score dropped from 9 to 4"
- "2 unresolved support tickets"
- "Order frequency declined 60%"

**These were aspirational examples in the documentation, not actual implementation!**

## üü° Risk Factors: Semi-Dynamic Explained

### The "reasons" array is:

- ‚úÖ **Dynamic in selection** (which reasons appear depends on data)
- ‚ùå **Hardcoded in text** (the actual words are static)

### Example:

**Customer A (Health: 35, Segment: VIP, Percentile: 20):**

```
Risk Factors: Low health score, High-value segment at risk, Below-average in cohort
```

‚Üí All 3 conditions met, shows all 3 reasons

**Customer B (Health: 55, Segment: Regular, Percentile: 75):**

```
Risk Factors: General churn risk indicators
```

‚Üí No specific conditions met, shows fallback reason

**Customer C (Health: 35, Segment: Regular, Percentile: 50):**

```
Risk Factors: Low health score
```

‚Üí Only 1 condition met, shows only that reason

**So the NUMBER and COMBINATION of reasons is dynamic, but the TEXT of each reason is hardcoded.**

## üöÄ How to Add "3 Failed Payments" (Real Dynamic Data)

If you want to add ACTUAL database-driven details like "3 failed payments", here's how:

### Step 1: Query the Database

Add this to `_create_proactive_event` method:

```python
def _create_proactive_event(self, customer, alert):
    # ... existing code ...

    # Query actual data from database
    payment_stats = self.proactive_monitor.analytics.get_customer_payment_reliability(customer)
    support_stats = self.proactive_monitor.analytics.get_customer_support_history(customer)
    nps_data = self.proactive_monitor.analytics.get_customer_nps(customer)
    order_stats = self.proactive_monitor.analytics.get_customer_order_stats(customer)

    # Build detailed reasons list
    detailed_reasons = []

    # Check payment failures
    if payment_stats and payment_stats.get('failed_payments_30d', 0) > 0:
        count = payment_stats['failed_payments_30d']
        detailed_reasons.append(f"{count} failed payment{'s' if count > 1 else ''} in last 30 days")

    # Check NPS changes
    if nps_data:
        # This would require NPS history query - currently only returns latest
        # For now, just show current NPS if it's low
        score = nps_data.get('nps_score')
        if score is not None and score <= 6:
            detailed_reasons.append(f"NPS detractor (score: {score}/10)")

    # Check support tickets
    if support_stats and support_stats.get('open_tickets', 0) > 0:
        count = support_stats['open_tickets']
        detailed_reasons.append(f"{count} unresolved support ticket{'s' if count > 1 else ''}")

    # Check order decline
    if order_stats and order_stats.get('frequency_decline_pct'):
        decline = abs(order_stats['frequency_decline_pct'])
        if decline > 30:
            detailed_reasons.append(f"Order frequency declined {decline:.0f}%")

    # Check days since active
    if customer.days_since_active and customer.days_since_active > 30:
        detailed_reasons.append(f"Inactive for {customer.days_since_active} days")

    # Fallback to generic reasons if no specific issues found
    if not detailed_reasons:
        detailed_reasons = alert['reasons']

    # Build description with detailed reasons
    description = f"""{customer.segment} customer at high risk (LTV: ${customer.lifetime_value:,.2f})
‚Ä¢ Health Score: {health_score:.0f}/100 ({health_status})
‚Ä¢ Churn Risk: {churn_risk:.0f}%
‚Ä¢ Issues Detected:
  - {chr(10).join(f'  - {reason}' for reason in detailed_reasons[:5])}
‚Ä¢ Recommended Action: {alert['recommended_action'].replace('_', ' ').title()}"""
```

### Step 2: Verify Data Availability

First, test if these methods return real data:

```bash
cd /c/Users/VijayJha/Documents/AgentMax-Hackathon/ProCX
python -c "
from utils.data_analytics import DataAnalytics
from utils.event_simulator import EventSimulator

# Load data
analytics = DataAnalytics()
simulator = EventSimulator()

# Get a test customer
customer = simulator.get_random_customer(segment='VIP')

# Test methods
print('Customer:', customer.customer_id)
print('Payment stats:', analytics.get_customer_payment_reliability(customer))
print('Support stats:', analytics.get_customer_support_history(customer))
print('NPS data:', analytics.get_customer_nps(customer))
print('Order stats:', analytics.get_customer_order_stats(customer))
"
```

## üéØ Final Answer

### "Is '3 payments failed' hardcoded?"

**Current answer:** It's **NOT IN YOUR CODE AT ALL** - neither hardcoded nor dynamic!

**What you have instead:** Generic reasons like "Low health score" (hardcoded text, dynamic selection)

**To make it real:** You need to add database queries (see Step 1 above)

---

## üí° Recommendation

### For Hackathon Demo:

**Option A: Keep it simple (what you have now)**

- Current description is good enough
- Shows dynamic data (segment, LTV, scores)
- Risk factors prove you're analyzing data
- Judges won't ask for every detail

**Option B: Add 1-2 specific metrics (30 minutes)**

- Add failed payments count
- Add support ticket count
- Makes demo more impressive
- Requires implementing Step 1 above

**Option C: Full implementation (1-2 hours)**

- Add all detailed metrics
- Query NPS history
- Calculate order trends
- Most impressive but time-consuming

**I recommend Option A or B.** You're already at 80% - don't over-engineer!

---

## ‚úÖ What to Say to Judges

**If judges ask:** "How do you know there are 3 failed payments?"

**Current honest answer:**

> "The health scoring system analyzes payment history as one of 10 factors. In the current demo, we show high-level risk factors. The detailed payment analysis is part of the scoring calculation - we can absolutely expose those specific metrics in the description if needed."

**After implementing Option B:**

> "We query the payments table directly - here's the exact count from the database. See? This customer has 3 failed payments in the last 30 days, which contributed to their low health score."

**The key:** Don't lie about what you have. What you have now is already impressive!
