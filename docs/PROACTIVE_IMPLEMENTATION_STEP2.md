## 🧠 Key Features

### 1. **Customer Health Scoring**
```python
health_score = calculate_health_score(customer)
# Returns: 0.0 (critical) to 1.0 (excellent)

# Factors (weighted):
# - Segment strength (30%)
# - LTV percentile (25%)
# - Loyalty tier (20%)
# - Relative value in segment (25%)
```

### 2. **Churn Risk Detection**
```python
at_risk = monitor.detect_churn_risks(
    min_churn_risk=0.6,
    min_lifetime_value=2000.0,
    segments=["VIP", "Loyal"]
)
```

**Returns:**
- Customer profile
- Health score (0-1)
- Churn risk (0-1)
- Risk level (low/medium/high/critical)
- Reasons for risk
- Recommended action
- Cohort percentile
- Similar customers count

### 3. **High-Value Inactivity Detection**
```python
inactive = monitor.detect_high_value_inactivity(
    min_lifetime_value=5000.0,
    inactivity_threshold_days=60
)
```

Identifies valuable customers who appear disengaged.

### 4. **Comprehensive Monitoring Report**
```python
report = monitor.generate_monitoring_report()
```

**Provides:**
- Total customers
- Average health score
- Average churn risk
- Customers at risk count
- Critical risk count
- Health distribution (excellent/good/fair/poor)

---

## 📊 Test Results

### Dataset Stats:
- **Total Customers:** 1,000
- **Average Health Score:** 77.13%
- **Average Churn Risk:** 24.03%
- **At Risk (≥60%):** 39 customers
- **Critical Risk (≥80%):** 1 customer

### Health Distribution:
- **Excellent (≥80%):** 459 customers (46%)
- **Good (60-80%):** 332 customers (33%)
- **Fair (40-60%):** 198 customers (20%)
- **Poor (<40%):** 11 customers (1%)

### VIP Analysis:
- **Total VIPs:** 37
- **VIPs at Risk:** 2 (with action recommendations)

---

## 🎯 Recommended Actions by Risk Level

The monitor automatically recommends actions:

| Customer Type | Churn Risk | Recommended Action |
|--------------|------------|-------------------|
| VIP | Any risk | `immediate_personal_outreach` |
| High LTV (>$5K) | Medium-High | `retention_offer_premium` |
| Loyal | Medium | `retention_offer_standard` |
| Others | Low-Medium | `engagement_campaign` |

---

## 💡 How It Works

### Proactive Detection Flow:
```
1. Scan all customers in dataset
   ↓
2. Calculate health score (4 factors)
   ↓
3. Calculate churn risk (inverse of health + adjustments)
   ↓
4. Compare with cohort for context
   ↓
5. Identify risk reasons
   ↓
6. Recommend specific action
   ↓
7. Return prioritized alerts (sorted by risk)
```

### Smart Adjustments:
- **VIPs:** 20% lower churn risk (more stable)
- **Occasional:** 20% higher churn risk (less loyal)
- **High LTV (>$10K):** Slightly higher priority

---

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Find All At-Risk Customers
```python
from utils import ProactiveMonitor

monitor = ProactiveMonitor()
at_risk = monitor.detect_churn_risks(min_churn_risk=0.6)

for alert in at_risk:
    print(f"{alert['customer'].full_name}: {alert['churn_risk']:.2%} risk")
    print(f"Action: {alert['recommended_action']}")
```

### Example 2: VIP-Only Monitoring
```python
vip_risks = monitor.detect_churn_risks(
    segments=["VIP"],
    min_churn_risk=0.3
)

for alert in vip_risks:
    # Immediate escalation for VIPs
    trigger_personal_outreach(alert['customer'])
```

### Example 3: Daily Health Report
```python
report = monitor.generate_monitoring_report()
send_dashboard_email(report)
```

## ✅ Next Steps

Now that we have the ProactiveMonitor detecting at-risk customers, we need to:

**Step 3:** Enhance Pattern Agent to use proactive predictions
**Step 4:** Create proactive workflow
**Step 5:** Build proactive runner/scheduler
**Step 6:** Add demo mode
