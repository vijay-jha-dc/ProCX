# üéØ ProCX Proactive Features - Judge Explanation Guide

## What Problems Does ProCX Solve Proactively?

### **The Core Innovation: Prevention > Reaction**

Traditional CX systems wait for customers to complain. ProCX **predicts and prevents** problems before customers even notice.

---

## üîÆ **6 Specific Proactive Scenarios We Tackle**

### **1. Silent Churn Detection** üö®
**Problem:** Customer hasn't ordered in 60+ days but hasn't complained  
**How we detect:** Inactivity analysis from `orders` sheet + `last_active_date`  
**Proactive action:** Re-engagement outreach with personalized offer  
**Business impact:** Recover customers before they switch to competitors

---

### **2. Declining Spending Patterns** üìâ
**Problem:** Customer's order value dropped from $80 to $30 per order  
**How we detect:** `avg_order_value` trend analysis from `orders` sheet  
**Proactive action:** Exclusive offer in their preferred category  
**Business impact:** Stop revenue decline early

---

### **3. Payment Failure Risk** üí≥
**Problem:** Customer had 3 payment failures - high churn indicator  
**How we detect:** `payments` sheet analysis (75% failure rate = red flag)  
**Proactive action:** Payment method update assistance + loyalty bonus  
**Business impact:** Prevent involuntary churn

---

### **4. NPS Detractor Intervention** üòû
**Problem:** Customer's NPS score dropped from 8 to 3  
**How we detect:** `nps_survey` sheet - score drop detection  
**Proactive action:** Service recovery outreach + executive attention  
**Business impact:** Convert detractors to promoters

---

### **5. Low Engagement Warning** ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem:** Loyal customer showing patterns similar to churned customers  
**How we detect:** `churn_labels` sheet - ML pattern matching  
**Proactive action:** VIP check-in + exclusive early access  
**Business impact:** Save high-value relationships

---

### **6. Support CSAT Risk** üìû
**Problem:** Customer has low average CSAT (2.5/5.0) from past tickets  
**How we detect:** `support_tickets` sheet - historical dissatisfaction  
**Proactive action:** Dedicated account manager assignment  
**Business impact:** Repair relationship before final churn

## üìä **How to Explain to Judges (30-second pitch)**

> "ProCX doesn't wait for customers to complain. Our 10-factor health score scans 1,000 customers across 10 data sheets - orders, payments, NPS, support history. We catch silent churn signals like '60 days inactive' or 'payment failures' and reach out BEFORE they leave. For example, we detect a Loyal customer who hasn't ordered in 2 months, analyze their $3,200 lifetime value, and auto-generate a personalized retention message in Hindi. It's prevention, not reaction."

## üí° **Judge Questions & Answers**

**Q: "What makes this proactive, not just automated?"**  
A: We scan WITHOUT waiting for customer events. We detect inactive customers, declining spending, payment failures - all silent churn signals.

**Q: "How do you know it works?"**  
A: We use `churn_labels` sheet (ground truth) to learn what churned customers looked like. Then find similar patterns in active customers.

**Q: "Why not just escalate everything to humans?"**  
A: AI handles 60-80% automatically. Humans only for: VIP + high risk, very low CSAT, or critical cases. Smarter = more scalable.

**Q: "What's the innovation over existing CX tools?"**  
A: Most tools are reactive ticket systems. We're predictive + preventive. We combine 10 data sources (payments, NPS, orders) that normal CX tools don't integrate.
