  - `registration_date` → `signup_date`
  - `total_spend` → `lifetime_value`
- ✅ Customer object construction fixed:
  - Added `first_name`, `last_name`, `preferred_category`
  - Removed invalid fields
- ✅ Workflow execution updated to use `run_workflow()`
- ✅ Input pauses removed for automated testing
- ✅ Full name construction from first_name + last_name

**Note:** File compiles but requires runtime testing with full dataset execution.
